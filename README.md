# HackTheU2018

!! This project writes random strings + varibles to a pdf document, and calculates varibles to create a random Dnd character sheet,
this makes each character diffrent from one another !!


!! Change the file path too your personal Form Fillable path !!
PDDocument pdf = PDDocument.load(new File("Character Sheet - Form Fillable.pdf"));
		EX: //C:\Users\mildo\Desktop\HackU 2018 DND\HackTheU2018\HackTheU2018\Character Sheet - Form Fillable.pdf
    
    !! First answer Male or Female then a pop box will appear behind your previous windows, here you will choose where to save the pdf,
    MAKE SURE WHEN YOU TYPE IN A NAME TO SAVE IT AS YOU ADD .pdf TO THE END OF THE FILE NAME !!
